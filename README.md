bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin structure prediction

This repository contains code for running the inference described in the preprint titled "bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin structure prediction" on an example dataset. After pulling the repository, activate the Julia environment by running `julia --project=.` in the repository's root directory, and then instantiate the environment with `using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()`. This will set up the required dependencies for the project. Then run `julia --project=. run.jl`.
